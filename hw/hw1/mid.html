          <p>And in this point in our story, things begin to get interesting. Abstraction, in earnest, comes into play in mid-level languages such as
          Java and C#. At this level, it becomes necessary to run builds through what is known as a 'virtual machine'. The virtual machine acts as an
          execution environment, a mediator betweeen the code you've created and the hardware trying to run it. Additionally, mid-level languages are
          often bootstrapped from low-level languages.</p>
          
          <p id="list">Key Characteristics:</p>
          <u1 id="list">
            <li id="listmarker">A high degree of abstraction for the creation of objects and allow for object-oriented-programming.</li>
            <li id="listmarker">"Garbage Collection" - a form of automated memory management for ease of use. </li>
            <li id="listmarker">Most commonplace in workplace environments.</li>
            <li id="listmarker">Easy to read program flow.</li>
          </u1>
          
          <p>Garbage collection, in many ways, is why C++ does not qualify as a mid-level language. Garbage Collection must be performed
          manually in C++, but not C#. </p>
