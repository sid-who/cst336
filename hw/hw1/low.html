          <p>  Of all these categories, the easiest to define is a 'low-level' programming language. Machine code and assembly are low level because they
          run directly on the processor, which make them ideal for writing operating systems or firmware for micro-controllers. Realistically, they
          can accomplish anything with the right amount of work, and that work is reflected in higher level programming languages. At their core
          all programming languages are built from this level up. It is the foundational level and, as such, has a multitude of applications.</p>
          
          <p id="list">Key Characteristics:</p>
          <u1 id="list">
            <li id="listmarker">Direct to memory management, with nearly nonexistent abstraction from hardware</li>
            <li id="listmarker">Direct access to Registers</li>
            <li id="listmarker">Correspondence with clock systems along statements.</li>
          </u1>
          
          <p>C, and by extension C++, constitute a curious case whereby they act in a manner very similar to low-level programming languages, but 
          also allow for degrees of abstraction. C, for example, can access registers and memory locations, but its constructs allow enough abstraction
          from the hardware to do some really interesting stuff.</p>
