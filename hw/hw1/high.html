          <p>And here we are... at the end of the line (for now). High-level programming languages
          represent an extreme application of the terms of abstraction and high-level constructs.
          So what's the difference between this idea and what happens in Java? Java, you see, is 
          object oriented, but also relies on primitives represented directly into memory.</p>
          
          <p>Ruby, by contrast, is <strong>entirely</strong> object-oriented. It has no primitives
          and everything can be treated as an object. In essence, the transition from mid-level to 
          high-level abstraction has allowed for more dynamic languages with limitless flexibility
          in algorithm design. </p>
