              <p> Programming Languages are the set of formal instructions for a computing device which allow it perform 
              specialized tasks. Each language is comprised of a set of unique keywords and specialized syntax for organizing
              those instructions. Regardless of where the language lies in terms of abstraction, all languages at their core rely
              on a conversion from their original language to machine language.</p>
              <p> At their core, these languages differ not in their purposes, but instead in their degrees of abstraction. That is
              to say, there is a difference in how explicit each level of the language must be in relation to the task it is trying to perform.
              Abstraction itself can be interpreted as this: A low level of abstraction would require that an individual, to create a circle, draw
              every point on that circle one dot at a time. A high level approach, however, would simply start at one point and make a circle. It wouldn't
              be perfect, but it would be done... Or, you know, abstract.</p>
